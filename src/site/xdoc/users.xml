		<section name="User Management">
			<p>
				The default user manager is configured via the file
				<i>hermesftp-users.xml.</i>
				This XML file contains the information about all ftp user groups, their resource
				consumption limits and permissions granted on data folders. It contains also a list
				of all users known to the system.
			</p>
		<subsection name="Group Configuration">
			<p>
				Users of the same group share similar permissions and resource constraints. You can
				configure as many groups as you like. However, we recommend that you configure at
				least two: users and administrators. A user group contains information about
				resource consumption limits and access permissions all group members a subjected to.
			</p>
			<p>
			Each resource consumption limit has a name and a value (see code snippet). Currently, there
			a four limits supported:
			<ul>
				<li>Bytes downloaded: Number of bytes the user is allowed to download per day.</li>
				<li>Bytes uploaded: Number of bytes the user is allowed to upload per day.</li>
				<li>Files downloaded: Number of files the user is allowed to download per day.</li>
				<li>Files uploaded: Number of files the user is allowed to upload per day.</li>
				<li>Download rate: Maximum data transfer rate in KB/s (download stream).</li>
				<li>Upload rate: Maximum data transfer rate  in KB/s (upload stream).</li>
			</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
			Each group contains a list permissions granted on ftp data folders. The folders are
			specified using ANT style patterns. You can read more about these patterns
			<a href="http://ant.apache.org/manual/index.html">here</a>.
			There two placeholders that can be included in path names: ${ftproot} corresponds to
			the setting <i>ftp.root.dir</i> in the application context file <i>hermesftp-ctx.xml</i> and
			points to the root ftp folder. The expression ${user} is replaced by the user name dynamically.
			A permission level is assigned to each of the path patterns:
			<ul>
				<li>r: Read only access.</li>
				<li>rw: Read/writeaccess.</li>
			</ul>
			The following code snippet demonstrates a typical group configuration:
			</p>
			<source>
&lt;groups&gt;
    &lt;group name=&quot;users&quot; &gt;
        &lt;limits&gt;
            &lt;limit name=&quot;Bytes downloaded&quot; value=&quot;1000000&quot;/&gt;
            &lt;limit name=&quot;Bytes uploaded&quot; value=&quot;1000000&quot;/&gt;
            &lt;limit name=&quot;Files downloaded&quot; value=&quot;100&quot;/&gt;
            &lt;limit name=&quot;Files uploaded&quot; value=&quot;100&quot;/&gt;
            &lt;limit name=&quot;Download rate&quot; value=&quot;-1&quot;/&gt;
            &lt;limit name=&quot;Upload rate&quot; value=&quot;-1&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;/limits&gt;
        &lt;permissions&gt;
            &lt;permission flag=&quot;rw&quot; path=&quot;${ftproot}/${user}/**&quot;/&gt;
            &lt;permission flag=&quot;rw&quot; path=&quot;${ftproot}/${user}&quot;/&gt;
            &lt;permission flag=&quot;r&quot; path=&quot;${ftproot}&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;/permissions&gt;
    &lt;/group&gt;
    ...
&lt;/groups&gt;

		</subsection>

		<subsection name="User Configuration">
		<p>
			Only users that are known to the application are granted access to the data folders.
			Each user is configured along with his/her login name, fullname, and password.
			A user may be member of different groups.

		</p>
		<p>
		    The user's password can be configured in plain text or as hashcode calculated by an supported algorithm.
		    The name of the algorithm is prepended to a BASE64 encoded string, e.g. "{MD5}Cwz8B/yoHJVquRgdhXb0qA==".
		    If the password does not start with a curly brace, it is handled as plain text.
		    Since Hermes FTP servers comes without GUI, the password hash is generated from the command line as follows:
		    <source>
java -jar hermesftp-&lt;version&gt;.jar -password &lt;secretpassword&gt; &lt;algorithm&gt;
		    </source>

		    Example:
		    <source>
c:\develop>java -jar hermesftp-0.2.jar -password sec MD5
Hash: {MD5}dEWco8+FqB35Dalf9ueiBw==
c:\develop>
		    </source>

		</p>
		<p>
		The following code snippet demonstrates a typical user configuration:
		</p>

		<source>
&lt;users default-dir=&quot;${ftproot}/${user}&quot;&gt;
    &lt;user uid=&quot;user&quot; 
             fullname=&quot;Test User&quot; 
             password=&quot;user&quot;&gt;
        &lt;group-ref name=&quot;users&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/user&gt;
    &lt;user uid=&quot;admin&quot;
             fullname=&quot;Administrator&quot;
             adminrole=&quot;true&quot;
             password=&quot;{MD5}dEWco8+FqB35Dalf9ueiBw==&quot;&gt;
        &lt;group-ref name=&quot;users&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;group-ref name=&quot;administrators&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/user&gt;
&lt;/users&gt;</source>

		<p>You can omit the password to enable anonymous login (An email address is expected as password).</p>
